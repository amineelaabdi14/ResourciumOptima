To install the dependencies for your Jakarta application using Maven, you can use the following steps:

Navigate to the root directory of your project.
Open a terminal window.
Run the following command:
mvn install
This will install all of the dependencies for your project, including Tomcat and the Jakarta EE API.

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can configure the run option in Eclipse to use Tomcat. To do this, follow these steps:

In Eclipse, right-click on your project and select Run As > Run Configurations.
In the Run Configurations dialog box, select the Maven Build configuration that you want to use.
On the Goals tab, add the following goal to the Goals list:
tomcat:run
Click the Run button.
This will start Tomcat and deploy your application to it. You can then access your application at the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/your-app-name
Here is an example of a README file that you can use for your Jakarta application:
